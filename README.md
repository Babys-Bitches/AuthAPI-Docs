API Documentation
This document explains how to interact with the API endpoints for authentication, retrieving a secure module (encrypted image), and fetching variables. All requests are sent to the host 45.13.227.206 on port 3845.

Note: SSL verification is disabled in the provided examples (i.e., CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER is set to 0). It is recommended to enable SSL verification in production environments.

Additional Notes
1. Authentication Endpoint
URL:
http://45.13.227.206:3845/backend/client/api/v1/authenticate
Method:
POST

Parameters (Form Data):
license: Your license key (string).
token: Your hardware ID (HWID). This value is typically retrieved from the system (e.g., using a user SID).
Description:
Submit your license key and HWID to authenticate. A successful response returns license details, a session token, and application information.

Example Request using cURL:
curl -X POST "http://45.13.227.206:3845/backend/client/api/v1/authenticate" \
     -d "license=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&token=YOUR_HWID"
Example Successful Response:

json
{
  "status": "success",
  "license": {
    "id": "license_id",
    "hwid": "your_hwid",
    "expiry": "expiry_date",
    "created_on": "creation_date",
    "duration": 12345
  },
  "token": "session_token",
  "app": {
    "id": "app_id",
    "name": "app_name",
    "version": "app_version",
    "status": "app_status",
    "created_on": "app_creation_date"
  }
}
2. Secure Module (Image) Endpoint
URL:
http://45.13.227.206:3845/backend/client/api/v1/module?token=<session_token>
Method:
GET

Parameters:
token: The session token obtained from the authentication response.
Description:
This endpoint returns an encrypted module (referred to as an image). The response includes an array of unsigned 32-bit integers that represent the encrypted data.

Decryption Process
Derive the Decryption Key:
The key is calculated by summing the ASCII values of each character in your license key.

Decrypt the Image:
Each element in the image array is XORed with the derived key.

Example Request using cURL:
curl "http://45.13.227.206:3845/backend/client/api/v1/module?token=SESSION_TOKEN"

3. Variable Retrieval Endpoint
URL:
http://45.13.227.206:3845/backend/client/api/v1/variables/<variable_id>?license=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
Method:
GET

Parameters:

variable_id: The identifier for the variable you wish to retrieve.
license: Your license key (string).
Description:
Retrieve details about a specific variable. On success, the response includes the variableâ€™s name and content.

Example Request using cURL:
curl "http://45.13.227.206:3845/backend/client/api/v1/variables/VARIABLE_ID?license=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
Example Successful Response:

json
{
  "status": "success",
  "variable": {
    "name": "variable_name",
    "content": "variable_content"
  }
}
Usage Workflow
Authenticate:

Call the /authenticate endpoint with your license and HWID to receive your session token, license details, and application info.
Retrieve the Secure Module:

Use the session token from authentication to request the secure module using the /module endpoint.
Derive the decryption key from your license (by summing its ASCII values) and decrypt the returned image by XORing each value with the key.
Retrieve Variables:

Use the /variables/<variable_id> endpoint with your license key and the variable ID to fetch variable details.
Additional Notes
SSL Verification:
The provided examples disable SSL verification. For production, make sure to enable SSL verification to ensure secure communication.

Error Handling:
If the authentication response contains an error message with "Restart", the request is automatically retried. Other errors result in displaying an error message and terminating the application.

Response Format:
All responses are in JSON format. Use a JSON parser to handle the response data in your application.
